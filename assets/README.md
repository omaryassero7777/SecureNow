# assets

This directory holds static asset files for the project (images, icons, fonts, sample certificates, etc.).

Guidelines:
- Keep only checked-in assets that are small and necessary for the repository (e.g. project logos, example/test data).
- Large or frequently changing binary assets should be stored in an external storage (CDN, object storage) and referenced by URL.
- If you want me to add specific assets (images, logos, or other files), upload them here or tell me which files to create.
